<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are loads of basic calculator app tutorials that all follow the same structure: one input for a number, a choice of operator, then an input for a final number. This is fine if you are just starting out but if you want to make a more powerful app or begin understand tokenising then this project could help get you started.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With

* C++
* C#
* JavaScript
* Python
* Rust

If there are any others that you'd like to see then just let me know.
